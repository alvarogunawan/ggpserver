<h2>Old games</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fairfield_S.3359145873 and Patapsco_S.3359145867 = Racetrack Corridor</li>
<li>Stringer_S.3359145972 and Avon_S.3359145990 = Chinesecheckers2</li>
</ul></p>
<p>
<h2>New games</h2>
<ul>
<li>Niko_S.3359145578 and Ziggy_S.3359145644: these were variants of the existing Peg Jumping game, but with 
a different starting position, different goals, and a "suicide" move that could end the game immediately.</li>

<li>Spiros_S.3359145732 and Sergei_S.3359145771: These were almost identical to the existing Queens axioms,
but as several people pointed out, the Queens axioms used in the last round allowed players to place
Queens in the last column of the board without any penalty-- these new axioms did not.</li>

<li>Carver_S.3359288708: This is Othello, with slightly different axioms which is some cases may
be more efficient to reason with than the old axiomitization.</li>

<li>Bodie_S.3359288834 and Bird_S.3359288923: These were Othello variants, where players earned 25 
points for marking each corner.  The game was also terminal if any player marked the upper left.</li>

<li>Muzone_S.3359289251 and Propjoe_S.3359289175:  These were 4-player versions of Othello, where the
first player picks the row in which to play the white piece, and the second player picks the column.
The third and fourth players similarly make moves for black.  The goals in these games were not the same-- 
in one, the white row player and the black column player get their maximal goal when black has the most pieces; in the other,
they get their maximal goal when white has the most pieces (in each case, the white column player and the black row player are 
trying to maximize the other color.  The Propjoe matches turned out poorly, with more than half of the
players having crashed or timing out before the game was half-over.  These matches (the Propjoe ones) were aborted and no scores taken.</li>

<li>Locust_S.3359299013 and Pit221_S.3359299094: These are Level1cp09source and Level1cp09target, respectively (games
on games.stanford.edu:4000).  These are chess variants, where the goal is simply to get your queen to
the opposite side of the board.  Both sides each have all pawns, a king, queen, and knight.  I'm 
classifying these as "new" games (even though they have been on the public testbed) because they 
used some more efficient Chess axioms than were available previously.</li>

<li>Mcnulty_S.3359146044 and Bunk_S.3359146085:  This is a Tic-tac-toe variant where two boards are in play 
simultaneously-- on the first move, X marks the first board while O marks the second.  Play continues until both
boards either have a line or are full.</li>

<li>Sobotka_S.3359145294 and Valchek_S.3359145512:  These games are a combined version of the Maze game plus a slightly
larger Blocks World problem.  The maximal goal comes from stacking the blocks correctly and then dropping the gold off in
the correct cell of the maze.</li>

We just needed unique identifiers for different game names.
