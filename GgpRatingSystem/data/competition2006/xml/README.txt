The XML files in this folder were created from the HTML tables in the
round#day#.html files. They only contain the information needed by the
GGP rating system: match id, roles, players, and scores. The move history
and final state are missing, but could be added from the information in the
rawmatches.txt files.
Also, the roles are only "role1", "role2" etc. instead of the real roles.
