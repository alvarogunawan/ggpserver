This document contains the following sections:

1. Building and Installation
2. General Usage
3. Adding new Data


=== 1. BUILDING AND INSTALLATION ===

GgpRatingSystem requires Java 1.5 or higher to run 
and Apache Ant to build.

You can get a list of available build targets
by executing "ant -projecthelp" in the same 
directory as the file build.xml.

To build:
- ant install

To generate developer documentation:
- ant javadoc

To run:
- install/ggp_rating_system.sh


=== 2. GENERAL USAGE ===

TODO

=== 3. Adding new Data ===

To add the data of a new competition (say, the AAAI Competition 2029 ;-)), the following 
steps must be executed:

-- 3.1 Build and install --

ant install


-- 3.2 Prepare the data --

a) Move all XML files into one directory, e.g. data/competition2029/xml/ . The files
   MUST be named <Match ID>.xml, all case-sensitive. So, if a file contains the line
   <match-id>Match.3391782873</match-id>, it must be called Match.3391782873.xml .

b) Create a new CSV (comma separated value) file called "match_index.csv" (case-sensitive!)
   in the data directory. For each XML file, add a line of the form

      <match ID> , <game name> , <year> , <round> , <day>
      e.g.: Match.3390055120,Blocksworld-Obfuscated,2007,1,1

   I found this easiest to do using a spreadsheet program. This file is necessary because
   the XML files do not contain this information, especially which game was played. The 
   "year/round/day" data isn't really important, but is no real extra effort to add anyways.
   A "match set" (a set of related matches) is identified by game name, year, round and day.
   The ordering of the lines in the CSV file is meaningless.

c) Optionally, create a file named "ignore_players.csv" in the data directory. List all
   players that should be ignored, one player name per line, e.g.:

RANDOM2
RANDOM3
RANDOM4
RANDOM
O-GRABME

   Player names are case-insensitive. Also, only alphanumeric characters will be used to 
   identify players, so O-GRABME is the same as oGrabMe. These players will still be counted 
   during calculation of all ratings, but will be excluded from the final output file(s).
   If ignore_players.csv is not present, all players will be counted.


-- 3.3 Run the rating system --

To generate a HTML table of the results, run:

   install/ggp_rating_system.sh 
      -i data/competition2029/xml/ 
      -o data/competition2029/output/
      -p data/competition2028/output/constant_linear_regression_1.0.csv  
      -c 1.0 
      -v
      -t

Please note that -p refers to 2028, not 2029. This will generate the file 
data/competition2029/output/constant_linear_regression_1.0.html .

-- 3.4 Troubleshooting --
If the XML format has suddenly changed (again), you have to adjust the file Match.java 
(which does the XML parsing).
