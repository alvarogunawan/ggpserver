<h1 class="notopborder">Welcome to the Dresden GGP Server!</h1>
	You can get information about 
	<a href="<%= request.getContextPath() + response.encodeURL("/public/show_matches.jsp") %>">past or running matches</a>,
	<a href="<%= request.getContextPath() + response.encodeURL("/public/show_tournaments.jsp") %>">tournaments</a> and
	<a href="<%= request.getContextPath() + response.encodeURL("/public/show_games.jsp") %>">all available games</a>
	by clicking on the links on the left. <br>

<h1 class="notopborder">What is it all about?</h1>
	The purpose of the server is to help development of <a href="http://www.general-game-playing.de/" target="_blank">General Game Playing</a> systems.
	The server provides an easy way to test general game players on a wide range of games against other players. The idea is that you just register
	your player and leave it online. The server will automatically pit players against each other on all games that are on the server.

<h1 class="notopborder">How to connect your player</h1>
	We do not host your player. To participate in a match, your player has to run on a computer with a working internet connection.
	After <a href="<%= request.getContextPath() + response.encodeURL("/register/register.jsp") %>">registration</a>/<a href="<%= request.getContextPath() + response.encodeURL("/login/login.jsp") %>">login</a>, 
	you can add your player (you have to enter host name or IP address and the port your player is running on). Your player will automatically be pitted
	against other players if you set its status to "active".

<h1 class="notopborder">Recent changes</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Users can now create/start matches manually.</li>
		<li>Users can now create own tournaments.</li>
		<li>You can choose if your players takes part in automatic round-robin tournament.</li>
		<li>You can choose if your players may be used in matches created by users.</li>
	</ul>

<h1 class="notopborder">Sourceforge project</h1>
	The server is open source. Join the <a href="http://ggpserver.sourceforge.net/">GGP Server SourceForge project</a> if you want to help with the development.
