<h1 class="notopborder">What is it all about?</h1>
	The purpose of the server is to help development of <a href="http://www.general-game-playing.de/" target="_blank">General Game Playing</a> systems.
	The server provides an easy way to test general game players on a wide range of games against other players. The idea is that you just register
	your player and leave it online. The server will automatically pit players against each other on all games that are on the server. Of course, you can also 
	start matches manually.

<h1 class="notopborder">How to connect your player</h1>
	We do not host your player. To participate in a match, your player has to run on a computer with a working internet connection.
	After <a href="<%= request.getContextPath() + response.encodeURL("/register/register.jsp") %>">registration</a>/<a href="<%= request.getContextPath() + response.encodeURL("/login/login.jsp") %>">login</a>, 
	you can add your player (you have to enter host name or IP address and the port your player is running on). Your player will automatically be pitted
	against other players if you set its status to "active".

<h1 class="notopborder">Recent changes</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>You can now define arbitrary filters for the matches you want to see. For the filtered matches you can view a chart showing the performance of the players over time.</li>
		<li>Support for GDL with incomplete information (GDL-II/GDL v2) and non-determinism was added. However, you need a GDL-II compliant player to play GDL-II games. &quot;Normal&quot; GDL games and players will still work as before. Please wait for our paper which will explain all the details about GDL-II.</li>
		<li>A few changes under the hood should make the creation of style sheets for the visualization easier.</li>
	</ul>

<h1 class="notopborder">Sourceforge project</h1>
	The server is open source. Join the <a href="http://ggpserver.sourceforge.net/">GGP Server SourceForge project</a> if you want to help with the development.
