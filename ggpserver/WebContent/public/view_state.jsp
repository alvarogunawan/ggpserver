<%@ page contentType="application/xml" %>
<%-- TODO: we're in a little dilemma here as to which content type to choose.

"application/xhtml+xml"
     Is the correct content type, works with Firefox, doesn't work with IE 6-8.

"application/xml":
	Also correct, should be more or less equivalent to "application/xhtml+xml".
	In theory. Works with Firefox and IE6.
	
"text/html":
     Is incorrect. Works with Internet Explorer 6.0, doesn't work with Firefox.
     
"text/xml":
	This is the EVIL content type (the rules how to determine the correct 
	encoding are completely braindead). Works with IE6, Firefox. --%>
