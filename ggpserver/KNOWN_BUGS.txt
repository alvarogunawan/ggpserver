=== public/view_state.jsp doesn't work with IE6 ===
We're in a little dilemma here as to which content type to choose.

"application/xhtml+xml" or, equivalently, "application/xml":
     Is the correct content type, works with Firefox, doesn't work with IE6.

"text/html":
     Is incorrect, works with Internet Explorer 6.0, doesn't work with Firefox.

Anyway, even if "text/html" is set as the content encoding, most of the site
(including the XSLT-transformed XML states) looks awful in IE6. The question is:
do we care? If we were professional web designers, we probably should (IE6 still
has around 25% market share).


=== Login doesn't work with cookies disabled ===
In theory, it should work out-of-the box (via Tomcat's URL rewriting, i.e., if 
the session ID can't be stored in a cookie, it is appended as a GET parameter
to every URL):

In practice, we get a "408 request timeout" when trying to login without cookies.
This is Tomcat's way of saying that the session is invalid. Somehow the URL rewriting
doesn't work, but I have no clue why.

ATM, this is a very low-priority bug. I believe we can expect everybody to just 
enable cookies.
