=== public/view_state.jsp doesn't work with IE6 ===
We're in a little dilemma here as to which content type to choose.

"application/xhtml+xml" or, equivalently, "application/xml":
     Is the correct content type, works with Firefox, doesn't work with IE6.

"text/html":
     Is incorrect, works with Internet Explorer 6.0, doesn't work with Firefox.

Anyway, even if "text/html" is set as the content encoding, most of the site
(including the XSLT-transformed XML states) looks awful in IE6. The question is:
do we care? If we were professional web designers, we probably should (IE6 still
has around 25% market share).


=== Login doesn't work with cookies disabled ===
This bug is fixed now. The only thing left to do is to use <c:url> or <% response.encodeURL() %> 
CONSISTENTLY EVERYWHERE, or else it won't work.
